## Lab 1 — Part 2: Printing the Area of a Circle and a Triangle

- Implements a base `Shape` class.
- Adds derived classes: `Circle` and `Triangle` with attributes `width`, `height`, and `radius`.
- Computes and prints the area for both shapes.
- Includes a simple **Makefile** with targets:
  - `make` — build the project
  - `make run_main` — run the compiled program
  - `make clean` — remove build artifacts
